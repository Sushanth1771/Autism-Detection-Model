# Autism-Detection-Model

Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition linked to high healthcare costs, which early diagnosis can help lower. 
However, long wait times and costly diagnostic processes hinder timely intervention. The rising global prevalence of ASD and its economic burden highlight the urgent need for efficient, accessible screening methods to assist health professionals and guide individuals toward formal diagnosis.  The increasing number of ASD cases worldwide demands datasets capturing behavioral traits for analysis. 
Yet, such datasets are scarce, limiting efforts to enhance the efficiency, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive accuracy of ASD screening. 
Most available autism datasets focus on genetics rather than clinical or screening data. 
To address this gap, we introduce a new dataset for autism screening in adults, featuring 20 attributes to support deeper analysis, identify key autistic traits, and improve ASD classification.
